# README

In this project I want to demonstrate what different types of documentation that can be part of a software product.
The documentation for this little project includes this README, a Changelog and a class diagram.

I demonstrate it on a simple project that calculates the area and circumferences of shapes.

## Installation

The program is a simple console program and not executable.

## Usage

Clone or download the code and open in your IDE or run via the Dart CLI tool from your favorite terminal:

```bash
  dart run lib/main.dart
```

## Prerequisites

The Dart language must be installed on your system. Alternatively, copy the code to [Dartpad](https://dartpad.dev).
